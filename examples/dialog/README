Build Instructions

## Resource Compiling
Prior to running crystal build the resource.rc needs to be compiled.
This can be done by running the following command with the x64
Native Tools Command Prompt for VS (command prompt with loaded vcvars).

```
rc resource.rc
```

If successful then there will be a new file named `resource.res` in the
directory.

## Crystal Compiling
When compiling you will need to pass in linker options to link the
compiled resource object.

```
crystal build window.cr --link-flags "/LIBPATH:<path to resource file> resource.res"
```
